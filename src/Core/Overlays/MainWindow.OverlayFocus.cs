/// Keeps keyboard focus out of whatever an overlay is covering.
///
/// <para><b>An overlay blocks the pointer and nothing else.</b> Settings, Help/Bugs and the
/// module host are hit-test-visible layers over the window's body, so a click can't reach what
/// is underneath - but XAML's focus navigation walks the visual tree without regard to
/// z-order or occlusion, so Tab walks straight into the body's buttons behind the acrylic and
/// Space presses them. That is how a second module used to open over the first, and a third over
/// that: the return button closes only the newest, and every module left underneath kept its
/// controls locked. Everything below makes "covered" mean covered for the keyboard too.</para>
///
/// <para><b>One rule, applied at the window's root, for every overlay at once:</b> while one is
/// open, focus may be inside the topmost open overlay, in the titlebar, or outside this window's
/// tree entirely - and nowhere else. The titlebar stays reachable because it is drawn above
/// every overlay and deliberately stays live over them (Help, Bugs, the return button, a
/// module's own titlebar buttons). "Outside the tree" is dialogs and flyouts, which live in
/// popups; redirecting their focus would make every ContentDialog unusable.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Two halves, and both are needed.</b> <see cref="OverlayFocus_GettingFocus"/> stops
/// focus <i>moving</i> into covered content, which is what Tab does. It cannot help with an
/// element that already <i>had</i> focus when the overlay came up - a slider in the body is
/// still focused after a <c>vanillartx://</c> link opens a module over it, and its arrow keys
/// still work. <see cref="OverlayFocus_PreviewKeyDown"/> catches that case: a key aimed at
/// covered content is swallowed and focus is moved into the overlay instead.</para>
///
/// <para>Nothing per overlay. A new overlay only has to be named in
/// <see cref="TopmostOpenOverlay"/>, in the same order their z-indices stack.</para>
