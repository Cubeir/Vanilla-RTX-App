/// A full-window overlay that fetches a GitHub markdown file's raw content and renders it as
/// plain WinUI elements - the read-only sibling of <see cref="WebImportOverlay"/>. Shares that
/// control's <see cref="OverlayHeaderBar"/> chrome (icon, hyperlinked title, Reload, Close) but
/// never spins up a WebView2 and never hands anything back to the caller: there is nothing to
/// import from a document, so <c>Show</c> takes just a URL, a title and a glyph.
///
/// <para><b>Why this exists instead of just pointing WebImportOverlay at the GitHub page.</b>
/// The Help and Bug-tracker buttons only ever showed a single README - paying for a full
/// Chromium instance (and GitHub's own page chrome, ads-adjacent trackers, and layout shift) to
/// display text that fits in a <see cref="Markdig.MarkdownPipeline"/> parse and a handful of
/// <see cref="TextBlock"/>s was the wrong tool for a job this small. Rendering the markdown
/// directly is also what makes the cache below possible - there's a single file to
/// cache, not a browser profile.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Pages are cached on disk and fetched at most once an hour</b>, the same model as
/// <see cref="OnlineTexts"/> and through the same machinery - see <see cref="DocumentAsset"/>
/// and <see cref="AssetUpdater"/>. raw.githubusercontent.com is effectively this app's CDN, and
/// a fetch on every launch, times every user, is requests spent on documents that change a few
/// times a year. Inside the cooldown the cached copy is shown without touching the network;
/// after it the page is fetched, and if that fails the cached copy is shown anyway, however old,
/// because a stale document beats an error card. Only a page that has never been fetched can
/// show the error.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Reload is rate-limited, deliberately, and it always goes to the network.</b>
/// A WebView2 "reload" is a browser doing what browsers already do constantly; this is a direct,
/// unconditional request to a git host's raw-content server, and a caller mashing the button has
/// no throttle standing between them and that server. <see cref="_reloadCooldownUntil"/> is a
/// static dictionary, keyed by page URL and storing *next allowed reload time* rather
/// than *last reload time* (the pattern <c>AssetUpdater</c> already uses) - that's what makes the
/// cooldown survive closing and reopening the overlay: it isn't instance state at all.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Clicking Help/Bug again is a toggle, and switching documents closes the one that was
/// open first.</b> <see cref="Show"/> re-clicked with the same URL while already open just closes
/// it (see <see cref="Close"/>). A *different* URL while one is open plays the same close
/// animation and only then opens the new document - not a silent content swap under a panel
/// that's still visibly there, and not two overlays stacking.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Rendering never throws</b> - see <see cref="MarkdownRenderer"/>'s own doc. Every
/// other failure mode (no internet, a 404 from a renamed branch, a malformed URL) is caught here
/// and shown as the same friendly <c>ErrorState</c> panel <see cref="WebImportOverlay"/> uses,
/// with a Try Again button that re-fetches without ever leaving the user looking at nothing.
