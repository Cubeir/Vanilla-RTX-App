#region Normal Map Generation

/// <summary>
/// Generates a normal map from a color texture, built on top of
/// HeightmapGenerator.ComputeClusteredHeights rather than raw color brightness - the
/// mean-shift clustered heightmap is the shared height-field basis for both texture
/// types now:
///   1. The clustered heightmap (raw, untouched) is blended with a ceiling-maximized flat
///      greyscale of the color texture, weighted by HeightmapBlendRatio (default 75%
///      clustered / 25% color), giving a clean height field that still carries some of
///      the original texture's own shading. The ceiling-maximize here only ever applies
///      to that color-texture greyscale, never to the clustered heightmap itself - a
///      *second*, independent ceiling-maximize of the clustered heightmap happens later,
///      purely for the POM blue channel (step 5) - the two are unrelated uses of the same
///      source array, not the same operation.
///   2. Gradients come from a Sobel operator sampled with wraparound indexing, so a pixel
///      on any edge sees its real neighbor from the opposite edge and the result tiles
///      seamlessly - which is what Bedrock's random rotation of isometric block textures
///      needs, since any two edges can end up meeting each other.
///   3. Those gradient magnitudes are normalized against this texture's *own* strong-edge
///      reference (a high percentile of its non-flat gradients - see
///      ResolveGradientReference), so a low-contrast texture still gets a well-formed
///      normal map and a bold one doesn't saturate into a wall of maxed-out edges. This is
///      what the old version lacked: with an unscaled gradient against a fixed Z of 1, a
///      one-level difference and a full black-to-white edge both landed within a degree
///      of each other, so nothing was ever weighted.
///   4. The normalized magnitude then goes through a response curve whose exponent is
///      driven by the per-texture noise index (GetNoiseIndex). A clean texture with
///      well-defined edges gets an exponent above 1: small differences are suppressed and
///      only genuinely big steps produce strong normals, so planks/bricks/tiles read
///      crisply. A noisy texture gets an exponent below 1, lifting its small differences
///      instead - subtle variation is all such a texture has to work with, and its edges
///      were never well-defined to begin with.
///   5. `intensity` (materials.json, default 0.25) scales the resulting slope *before* the
///      normal is built and normalized, so it controls real surface steepness rather than
///      fading an already-encoded normal toward flat. Every output stays a true unit
///      normal at any intensity, and 0 gives a perfectly flat map.
///   6. The blue channel is always overwritten with parallax-occlusion-mapping height
///      data sourced from the *raw* clustered heightmap, separately ceiling-maximized and
///      contrast-reduced (Bedrock RTX reads POM from the normal map's blue channel) - see
///      ApplyPomBlueChannel. This is on for every texture unconditionally; there's no
///      per-block opt-out at generation time. Downstream shader/renderer settings (e.g.
///      BetterRTX) are the right place to let a *player* disable reading POM data - that's
///      not something to gate here.
///
/// Deliberately does no blurring at any stage. Blurring the finished map can't respect the
/// wraparound its gradients were built with - the blur's own edge handling doesn't wrap -
/// so the outermost pixels stop matching the opposite edge. That's invisible on a statically
/// placed tile, but Bedrock randomly rotates isometric block textures, and those mismatched
/// edges then meet each other and show up as seams. The noise index shapes the response
/// curve (step 4) instead, which calms a busy texture without ever touching edge continuity.

        // measurement of how far apart the texture's own materials sit. Placing at evenly
        // spaced slots by rank - which this used to do - throws that measurement away and
        // asserts that every step is the same size. It never is. On a plank texture that
        // put a board's internal edge shading exactly as far below its face (85 levels) as
        // the mortar gap between boards, which is the single most obvious thing a heightmap
        // has to get right.
        //
        // Normalizing rather than using the means directly is what keeps this from being
        // the value-based placement that was tried and reverted (CLAUDE.md 9.3). Anchoring
        // the darkest bucket at 0 and the brightest at 255 guarantees full contrast no
        // matter how narrow the source's range was, so a low-contrast texture can't come
        // out as a flat grey smear; only the RELATIVE spacing in between is the texture's
        // to decide. The other half of why 9.3 failed - dozens of surviving levels, each
        // faithfully reproducing wood grain as elevation - is handled by MaxClusters, which
        // caps the ladder at four rungs before any of this runs.

        // Measured on the same 28-texture corpus as the constants above: the resulting
        // ladder departs from even spacing by a median of 22 levels and up to 72, with over
        // half the corpus moving more than 20 - so this is a real change in output, not a
        // rounding difference. Planks go from [0,85,170,255] to [0,95,220,255]: the two
