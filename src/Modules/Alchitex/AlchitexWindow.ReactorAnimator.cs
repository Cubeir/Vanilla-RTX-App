/// <summary>
/// Drives the Generate button's three layers so the reactor reads as a live instrument
/// rather than a picture of one - the same idea as the main window's lamp
/// (Core/MainWindow.LampAnimator.cs), tied here to what generation is actually doing:
///
///   1. Background - a 3x3 grid of tiles built here, not an image. Each tile holds an index
///      into whichever of two palettes is currently active (see _activePalette) - five
///      blues normally, a parallel five reds while the alert palette is up - and the whole
///      point of this class is deciding when, how, and against which palette those change.
///   2. Logo - the static mark. Never animated; it's the still point everything else moves
///      around.
///   3. Bloom - the same mark with its glow, animated by opacity alone.
///
/// Vocabulary, by state:
///   - Rest: the tiles' default diagonal arrangement (brightest top-right, darkest
///     bottom-left, straight off the reference art) and the bloom settled at a fixed middle
///     opacity (RestBloomOpacity) - deliberately not randomized. The bloom now has three
///     tiers with real contrast between them (press near-zero, rest in the middle,
///     flower-dance hover near max), and a random rest could land close enough to the hover
///     tier that unhovering stopped reading as a drop at all.
///   - Flower dance / press-and-hold: one mechanic, two readings. Idle and hovering, the
///     four corners and the four edge-midpoints swap places within their own ring,
///     independently and on their own schedule, around a centre that keeps changing on its
///     own, corners dark and edges bright; the bloom rises to near max. Pressed, the same
///     mechanic runs inverted - corners bright, edges dark - while the bloom collapses to
///     near zero instead, as though the charge is being drawn out from the middle. Neither
///     means anything about the pipeline, unlike everything else here - they exist purely so
///     hovering and pressing have an answer at all while idle.
///   - Generating: one behavior per phase (see Pulse). Underneath all of them the bloom
///     breathes on a loop, which is what separates "running" from "idle" at a glance.
///   - Waiting: the reactor is powered but blocked on something outside itself - a
///     confirmation dialog, a pack being uninstalled, a folder sweep. A single bright cell
///     orbits the eight perimeter tiles with a fading tail behind it, which is the one
///     stance here that reads as "this is not finished, and it is not your turn yet".
///   - Abort hint / error flash: the two places the alert palette (AlertPalette) takes over
///     from the blues. Hovering the button mid-run is just the swap, held for as long as the
///     pointer stays - "click me and this stops" - with nothing painted over it, so whatever
///     the run is actually doing keeps animating underneath, just red instead of blue. A
///     pack aborting on error, or being handed back mid-run, gets a timed version instead:
///     every tile flashes to it at once and eases back on its own.
///
/// How often a phase reports decides what kind of behavior it can have, and getting this
/// wrong is invisible in code and obvious on screen:
///   - Reports continuously (GeneratingTextures) -> a per-pulse behavior. It is also the
///     only phase long enough to show off a one-shot flourish.
///   - Reports once, then works for a long time in silence (Staging, copying thousands of
///     files; ScanningTextures, the orchestrator's own single pass over the whole pack) ->
///     a timer. BeginPhaseLoop exists for exactly this: a per-pulse behavior has a single
///     pulse to work with and leaves the reactor looking switched off for the length of the
///     phase. Staging repeats the ripple (its own field rerolled each time); Scanning
///     repeats the travelling gradient GeneratingTextures otherwise only shows off in a
///     short random burst.
///
/// Running behaviors are built from two ingredients: tiles firing at random, and a
/// travelling gradient (StepGradientWave) - the resting arrangement's own diagonal ramp
/// rolled across the grid. Phases that mean a direction are pure gradient and keep theirs;
/// GeneratingTextures mixes both (StepBusyWork).
///
/// On top of those sit the one-shot flourishes - PlayQueueWash, PlayRipple, PlayImplosion,
/// PlayCompletionWash. They aren't driven by a pulse or a timer; something happened and the
/// reactor answers once, across staggered tiles over several hundred milliseconds. Because
/// of that they take the grid for their duration (ClaimGrid) - otherwise the next pulse
/// repaints all nine tiles and the flourish never finishes.
///
/// BeginAbortHint and PlayErrorFlash are neither pulse-driven nor flourishes, and they touch
/// no tile directly - they only flip _activePalette, for as long as the pointer hovers or a
/// fixed interval respectively, and let whatever is already painting the grid (a phase, a
/// flourish, either one) carry on completely undisturbed underneath. Both used to claim the
/// grid and paint their own shape over it; that was reverted because it meant the one thing
/// actually happening at the time - the run's own progress, or the eject animation for the
/// very pack that just failed - was exactly what got hidden.
///
/// Everything routes through AnimateTile/SetBloom, which honor
/// EnvironmentVariables.Persistent.SuspendUIAnimations: with it on, every transition is applied
/// instantly and the looping behaviors (bloom breathing, the flower dance's swapping) never
/// start. The reactor still tracks state, it just stops moving.
///
/// Cost control matters here, and it has two halves that are easy to confuse:
///
///   * The frame rate is MinPulseIntervalMs. PulseGeneratingTextures is called once per
///     texture - thousands of calls a second on a real pack - and the throttle is what
///     bounds that to a fixed cost. Nine brushes' worth of colour animation is cheap; nine
///     thousand is not. This is the knob for a slow machine.
///   * How fast it *feels* is the transition durations, which are a separate thing
///     entirely. They are all shorter than the pulse interval on purpose: a transition
///     still easing when the next one starts on top of it is what made the reactor look
///     sluggish while changing stances rapidly.
///
/// A tile runs exactly one storyboard at a time, and starting a new sequence stops the one
/// before it - see PlayTileSequence for why that is load-bearing rather than tidy, and what
/// it means for anything that wants two things happening on one tile at once.
