# How-To-Use (Beginner Quick Guide)

For detailed documentation, refer to the main [`README.md`](https://github.com/Cubeir/Vanilla-RTX-App/blob/master/README.md).

This guide is for users who don't want any technical breakdown and just want to get RTX working quickly.

## Quick Setup (Do This First)

1. **Install the app from the Microsoft Store, open the app.**  
2. Click **`Install latest RTX packages`**  
   - This installs the official Vanilla RTX resource packs.  
   - It also ensures you always have only the latest version installed by automatically updating the pack when necessery.
3. Click **`Launch Minecraft with RTX`**  
   - Starts the game with ray tracing pre-enabled, avoiding all launch-related issues.  
4. In Minecraft → **Settings → Global Resources → Enable one of the provided Vanilla RTX resource packs.** (Their differences are documented on their CurseForge pages.)
5. Enter your world.

You’re done!  
Now ray tracing is enabled properly, you have the latest version of [Vanilla RTX](https://github.com/Cubeir/Vanilla-RTX), which is kept updated for the latest version of Minecraft, with bug fixes for as many issues as possible.

## Optional: DLSS Version Swapper  
_Use this for sharper visuals or if DLSS doesn’t work on RTX 50 GPUs._

1. Open the **DLSS** panel.  
2. Import a DLL (or a `.zip` with multiple DLLs).  
3. Pick any version in your catalogue to install it.

Notes:  
- The app preserves your currently installed DLL automatically.  
- Useful for upgrading Minecraft’s outdated DLSS version.  
- Required for RTX 50 series users (Minecraft ships a broken DLSS version).

## Optional: BetterRTX Preset Manager  
_Use this to install community-made BetterRTX presets._

1. Open the **BetterRTX** panel.  
2. Download `.rtpack` or `.zip` preset files from BetterRTX’s website.  
3. Drag/drop them into the app or use the file picker.  
4. Click a preset to install it.

Notes:  
- A built-in **Default** preset is automatically created from your game files.  
- You can switch between presets instantly.  
- Works on Minecraft GDK 1.21.120+.

## Optional: Tuning (Customize the overall appearance)

These controls let adjust Vanilla RTX or any other PBR resource pack.  
Once you've came up with the parameters you want used, press `Tune selection` to apply them to the selected packs.
Safely experiment on Vanilla RTX, since you can always reset to the original state by clicking  `(Re)install latest RTX packages`.

### Available Tuning Options
- **Fog multiplier**  
  Allows you to control the overall density of fog effects.

- **Emissivity multiplier**  
  Makes glowing stuff look brighter.

- **Increase ambient light**  
  Adds a subtle glow everywhere, letting you see better in darkness.

- **Normal intensity**  
  Increase or decrease the intensity of bump/height details on surfaces.

- **Material grain offset**  
  Adds randomized noise to PBR textures for an added layer of detail.

- **Roughness control**  
  Makes surfaces more or less shiny overall.

- **Lazify surface normals**  
  Adds a layer of organic detailing to surfaces.

# Staying Updated

The app may show announcements when an important Vanilla RTX update is out, yet again simply press:

**`(Re)install latest RTX packages`**

This way you'll always get the newest compatible version automatically.

# Troubleshooting

- If something looks out of place or if you break any of the Vanilla RTX packs -> Click **`(Re)install latest RTX packages`** to restore the latest update of the packs.

- If the app behaves strangely -> Use **Hard Reset**: **Shift + Reset** inside the app. This makes it just as if the app wa freshly installed with no save or cached data.

- If icons are missing (squares appear) -> Install [**Segoe Fluent Icons**](https://aka.ms/SegoeFluentIcons) from Microsoft.
